# One Shot RPG

In this game you play as a crusader on a quest to destroy the evil amulet of the dead. You progress by clicking tiles and defeating enemies.

and from the layout of the popular game "Slay the Spire"

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. And I will also be updating this game to add more classes and fix bugs.

When requesting a pull, please state:
* What you added
* The expected behavior.
* Screenshots for GUI issues.
* The application version.
* bugs found that were fixed
* bugs found/created that are unfixed

## Current Bugs/Breaks
*tiles need to be completely reformatted at a smaller screen width
*Clicking the next button too fast (within .5s of the end of the prior battle) will open the background of that event without opening the event itself, causing a need for a page refresh and restart
